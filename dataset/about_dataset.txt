this is a custom dataset that processed images generated by googles icrawler images.

after sifting and processing the images, 3 csv files were generated from the images.

they contain the distances recorded using googles mediapipe api that has a hand recognition model.

the model provides 21 landmarks with x,y,z coordinates, the CSV file contains the distances from each landmark
to the wrist landmark,resulting into 20 values per hand.

since i have provided the csv files directly, the file processing_single_images.py is kinda obsolete, 
but you can make you own data set by making 3 files "thumbs_up" "thumbs_down" "non_wanted" and putting images 
of corresponding gestures, and then it generates csv files with similar names.
